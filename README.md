TestShopping - Automation Testing using java

I have used a Page object model design to write the automation tests and are implemented using TestNG. I have written  the tests in the order of the names they have been assigned in the question(test1, test2 and test3).

These tests are executed using Firefox browser and could be run as TestNG.

The output reports are written to the folder as
/Users/…../Repo/testshopping/test-output/Test Suite/ xxxxx.html


Failed Tests screenshots are written to the folder 
/Users/…./Repo/testshopping/test-output/failedScreenshots 

Further Improvements:

Reports need improvements in terms of getting different views(example pie charts,  pictorial) of the reports.

Grabbing screenshot also needs improvement in terms of capturing the whole screen
